# Stock Prediction Portal

This project, **"Stock Prediction Portal,"** is a full-stack web application built using:
- **Django REST Framework** for the backend.
- **React.js** for the frontend.
- **Machine Learning (LSTM)** for accurate stock price predictions. 

It was developed as part of a hands-on online course designed to provide practical experience in these in-demand technologies.

## About the Project
This isnâ€™t just a theoretical exercise; itâ€™s a comprehensive, real-world application that demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a stock prediction platform. Key functionalities include:

âœ… **Robust Backend APIs (Django REST Framework):** Designed to handle data efficiently and power the application's core features.  
âœ… **Dynamic Frontend (React.js):** Provides an interactive user interface for visualizing stock predictions.  
âœ… **Machine Learning for Stock Prediction (LSTM):** Leverages Long Short-Term Memory models for accurate stock forecasts.  

## What I Learned
Throughout this project, I gained practical experience in:
- Django REST Framework (building scalable APIs).  
- React.js (dynamic frontend development).  
- LSTM models for stock price predictions.  
- Time series data fundamentals.  
- API integration (backend + frontend).  
- Real-world data handling & visualization.
